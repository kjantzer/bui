Panel Presenter
===================

Presents a view as an overlay panel. Panels can be full size, vary in width/height, and anchor to
different areas on the screen.

## Panel

```javascript
let panel = new Panel(view, options)
panel.open()
```

### Options

- `title` (will be displayed in `b-panel-toolbar`)
- `width` (string)
- `height` (string)
- `anchor` (top, right, bottom, left, center)
- `type` ('', modal, actionsheet)
- `closeBtn` (bool) - will show a close button in the top right
- `animation` ('scale' [only works on anchor=center], 'drop', 'rise')
- `quickJump` (bool) - show quick jump menu when right click on close btn
- `disableBackdropClick` - by default clicking backdrop will close panel
- `disableOverscrollClose` - by default pulling down in overscroll (iOS) and letting go will hide the top panel
- `closeOnEsc` - default is false
- `controller` - specify a different panel controller (see below)
- `onClose` - do something before closing; return `false` to stop closing
- `onBackdropClick` - do something when backdrop clicked; return `false` to stop closing
- `onKeydown` - only fires if panel is on top (of other panels)

### Basic Use
It is best practice to give panels a name of a custom element to render

```javascript
import {Panel} from 'bui'

let panel = new Panel('custom-element', {
    title: 'My Custom Element View',
    width: '600px',
    height: '800px',
    anchor: 'center'
})

panel.open()
```

**Tip:** panels will link themselves to the custom element they are rendering with `.panel`.
So inside of `custom-element` you can access the panel with `this.panel`

### Dynamic html
Rendering panels this way probably shouldn't happen very often, but it is supported.

```javascript
import {Panel} from 'bui'
import {html} from 'lit-html'

new Panel(()=>html`
    <b-panel-toolbar></b-panel-toolbar>
    <section>	
        <p>Dynamically generated content</p>
    </section>
`, {title: 'Custom Panel'}).open()
```

### Registering a Custom Element
Panel is integrated with `router` allowing for panels be opened via url.
The registered panel will not be created until the url is triggered

```javascript
import {Panel, router} from 'bui'

// Panel.register(path, view, options)
Panel.register('my-custom-element', 'custom-element', {
    title: 'My Custom Element View'
})

router.goTo('my-custom-element')
// url will change to `/#/my-custom-element`
```

#### Events
`onOpen(state)`  
If the custom element implements `onOpen`, the panel will call it with the
route `state` object

`async willOpen(state)`
Called right before opening. If the function returns `false`, the panel
will not open

### Animation
There are some built in animations

```js
panel.shake()
panel.bounce()
```

### Permissions
Registered panels support a `permission` option to keep the view from opening under certain circumstances. For it to work you must set the `permissionCheck` function.

```js
import Panel from 'bui/presenters/panel';

// provide custom logic for testing permissions
Panel.permissionCheck = permission=>{
    if( permission == 'admin' && !user.isAdmin )
        return false
    return true
}

Panel.register('my-custom-element', 'custom-element', {
    title: 'My Custom Element View',
    // permission will be evaluated before opening
    permission: 'admin', // Panel.permissionCheck used
    // permission(){ return user.isAdmin } // or provide inline function
})
```

>NOTE: disabling panels with permission is only a convient way to reduce UI clutter for certain users. It should be accompanied with a server permission check on any API requests if it is truely critical the user doesn't have access.


## Controller
Panels are rendered inside of a panel controller `<b-panels></b-pannels>`.

When the first panel is opened a root controller will be created and appended
to the the body. If you wish for the root controller to be rendered somewhere
other than the root of body, you can create one ahead of time

```html
<body>
    <main>
        <b-panels name="root"></b-panel>
    </main>
</body>
```

### Multiple Controllers

Panels can also be opened inside of other panel controllers by first creating the controller
with a different name and then specifying the controller in the panel opts

```html
<b-panels name="sub-panel"></b-panels>
```

```js
let panel = new Panel('custom-element', {
    controller: 'sub-panel'
})
```

>Note: if the controller cannot be found, the root controller will be used

### Events
When a controller has all of it's panels closed, it will dispatch a `panels-closed` event

```js
window.addEventListener('panels-closed', e=>{
    if( e.target.name == 'root' )
        console.log('all root panels closed')
})
```

## Toolbar

A panel only presents the view given to it. If you would like a toolbar with a close button the view
needs to render one. A panel toolbar element has been created for such a task.

```html
<b-panel-toolbar></b-panel-toolbar>
```
>A close button will be rendered and a title will be displayed if the panel has a `title` property set

### Slots

- `left`
- `right`
- `middle` - in place middle title block
- `title` - in place of title
- `title:before`
- `title:after`
- `close-btn` - use your own close button

```html
<b-panel-toolbar>
    <span slot="middle">I will appear after the title</span>
    <span slot="right">
        <b-btn>Right Button</b-btn>
    </span>
</b-panel-toolbar>
```

### Attributes

- `shadow`
- `overlay`
- `notitle`

## Fullscreen Button

```js
import 'bui/presenters/panel/fullscreen-btn'
```
Adds a fullscreen button and attaches a `fullscreen()` method to the panel

```js
panel.fullscreen({
    close: false, // will close if alredy in minimized state
    toggle: true // change to false to only make fullscreen
})
```

```html
<b-panel-toolbar>
    <b-panel-fullscreen-btn></b-panel-fullscreen-btn>
</b-panel-toolbar>
```

The fullscreen button needs to be linked to the parent `Panel`. This will happen automatically if nested inside a panel toolbar. Alternatively, you need to link it yourself

```html
<b-panel-fullscreen-btn .panel=${this.panel}></b-panel-fullscreen-btn>
```

> Note: this is a subclass of `b-btn` so you can add supported attributes such as `color="theme"` or `text`

## Modal
Although designed as a large panel view, panels can be leveraged to present
modal (popup/alert) windows. This can be accomplished through the options
parameter or through the convenient Modal function

```js
import {Modal} from 'bui/presenters/panel'

Modal('my-view')
Modal('my-view', {width: '400px', closeBtn: true})
```

**Note** `closeOnEsc:true` will be automatically set when `closeBtn:true` is set 

## ActionSheet
You can use `type:"actionsheet"` or import and use the function

```js
import {ActionSheet} from 'bui/presenters/panel'

ActionSheet('my-view')
ActionSheet('my-view', {anchor: 'top'})
```

## Shortcuts
Registered panels can opt-in to a "shortcuts" feature. A list of available shortcuts can be accessed with `register.shortcuts`

Shortcuts were originally developed for `Search Popup`, but they may also be useful for other things, such as creating a menu system.

```js
import Panel, {register} from 'panel'
console.log(register.shortcuts)
```

### Opt-in
```js
Panel.register('path', 'custom-element', {
    title: 'Title',
    icon: 'icon-name',
    shortcut: true // use ^ title, icon and root registered path
})

Panel.register('issue(/:id)', 'issues-list', {
    title: 'Issues',
    icon: 'bug',
    shortcuts: [
        {
            // main title & icon ^ will be used if none given
            description: 'See all issues'
        },{
            title: 'New Issue',
            // args will be used to create a url with the registered path
            args: {id: 'new'},
            // anything else listed here will be part of the shortcut
            custom: 'value',
        }
    ]
})
```
